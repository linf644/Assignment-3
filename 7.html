          In my next life, I want to live my life backwards.<br />
          You start out dead and get that out of the way.<br>
          Then you wake up in an old people's home,<br />
          Feeling better every day. <br />
          You get kicked out for being too healthy,
          <br />
          Go collect your pension,<br>
          And then when you start work,<br />
          You get a gold watch and a party on your first day.<br />
          You work for 40 years until you're young enough<br />
          To enjoy your retirement.

          You party, drink alcohol, <br />
          And are generally promiscuous, <br />
          Then you are ready for high school. <br />
          You then go to primary school,<br>
          You becomre a kid, <br>
          you play. <br />

          You become a baby until you are born. <br />
          Then you spend your next 9 months<br>
          Floating in luxurious spa-like conditions <br />
          With central heating and room service on tap, <br />
          Larger quarters every day and then <br />
          Voila! You finish off as an orgasm!</span>
