						You start out dead and get that out of the way.<br>
						Then you wake up in an old people's home, <br>
						Feeling better every day.<br>
						You get kicked out for being too healthy, <br>
						Go collect your pension,<br>
						And then when you start work,<br>
						You get a gold watch and a party on your first day.<br>
        </div>
        <div id="text82">
						You work for 40 years until you're young enough<br>
						To enjoy your retirement.<br>
						You party, drink alcohol, <br><br>
						And are generally promiscuous, <br>
						<em>
								Then you are ready for high school. <br>
								You then go to primary school, <br>
								<a href="9.html" style="text-decoration:underline">You becomre a kid, you play.</a><br>
								You have no responsibilities. </em><br>
        </div>
        <div id="text83">
								You become a baby until you are born.
							<br>
						Then you spend your next 9 months <br>
						Floating in luxurious spa-like conditions <br>
						With central heating and room service on tap, <br>
						Larger quarters every day and then <br>
							<h3>
								Voila! You finish off as an orgasm!</h3>
