        In my next life, I want to live my life backwards. <br>
        You start out dead and get that out of the way. <br>
        Then you wake up in an old people's home, <br>
        Feeling better every day. <br>
        You get kicked out for being too healthy, <br>
        Go collect your pension,<br>
        And then when you start work,<br>
        You get a gold watch and a party on your first day.<br>
        You work for 40 years until you're young enough<br>
        To enjoy your retirement. <br>
        You party, drink alcohol, <br>
        And are generally promiscuous, <br>
        Then you are ready for high school. <br>
        You then go to primary school, <br>
        You becomre a kid, you play. <br>
        You have no responsibilities. <br>
        You become a baby until you are born. <br>
        Then you spend your next 9 months <br>
        Floating in luxurious spa-like conditions <br>
        With central heating and room service on tap, <br>
        Larger quarters every day and then <br>
        Voila! <a href="2.html" style="text-decoration:underline">You finish off as an orgasm!</a>
