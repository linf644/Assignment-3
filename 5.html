      In my next life, I want to live my life backwards. <br />
      You start out dead and get that out of the way. <br />
      Then you wake up in an old people's home, <br />
      Feeling better every day. <br />
      You get kicked out for being too healthy, <br />
      Go collect your pension,<br />
      And then when you start work,<br />
      You get a gold watch and a party on your first day.<br />
      You work for 40 years until you're young enough<br />
      To enjoy your retirement. <br />
      You party, drink alcohol, <br />
      And are generally promiscuous, <br />
      Then you are ready for high school. <br />
      You then go to primary school, <br />
      You becomre a kid, you play. <br />
      You have no responsibilities. <br />
      You become a baby until you are born. <br />
      <a href="6.html">Then you spend your next 9 months </a><br />
      Floating in luxurious spa-like conditions <br />
      With central heating and room service on tap, <br />
      Larger quarters every day and then <br />
      Voila! You finish off as an orgasm!
